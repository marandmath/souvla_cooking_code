# Souvla Cooking

Python code using Dedalus v3 to simulate the cooking of Cyprusâ€™ national dish, souvla, over a foukou (traditional grill). For more details, see: [https://mariosandreou.short.gy/SouvlaCooking](https://mariosandreou.short.gy/SouvlaCooking). This is a work-in-progress project.

Use `requirements.txt` to download the necessary Python packages required to execute this code in your virtual environment.

The file `paper.pdf` contains the project's writeup, including the model setup and theoretical background.
